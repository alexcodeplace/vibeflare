# GitHub-hosted diagnostic artifacts: removal gates

## Authorized leaf
Remove only independent GitHub Actions diagnostic uploads, preserve local captures, logs, test/coverage and deployment/release gates. Disable Docker build-record upload where applicable. Preserve required cross-job release transfers pending orchestrator review. Worktree branch: wt/github-hosted-artifacts-zero-20261009. Base: 769198404cb8744c854f5473b8f2d2bbb1cb3d34.

## Gates
- [x] Source and dependency audit: read applicable instructions and enumerate exact hosted producers and consumers.
- [x] Implementation: remove complete diagnostic action references, preserve all producing commands and independent receipts, and add a regression assertion only where an existing suitable contract exists.
- [x] Verification: inspect exact diff and run the applicable focused source contract in K3s on debian3; retain exact published source identity, real pod node, command and receipt.
- [x] Handoff: commit and publish the isolated feature branch through publish-pr-source, report remaining release/deployment transfer blockers and keep main unchanged.

## Constraints and outcome record
The installed od-testing K3s workflow is required. Coordinator scratch stays within .cache/github-hosted-artifacts-zero/ in this worktree. No tests or builds run on the VM. A per-run copy of the installed wrapper changes only the helper-directory resolution and explicit node from auto to debian3; the orchestrator approved this exact two-line placement adaptation. The supplied unlazy leaf template was unavailable earlier in this task; these measured gates implement the required acceptance contract.

Status: gates established before workflow edits; source and execution evidence pending.

Source review: every remaining command, runner selector, trigger, timeout, local capture, report producer and functional deployment/release handoff remains unchanged. The only functional receipt-routing amendment is ForumZone's existing structured-log fallback running unconditionally after hosted-copy removal. No shared cache, release asset or package is changed. Full .github and available scripts/tools/tests/docs searches found no automated consumer of the removed diagnostic copies. Known release transfers in quietcontext/slopgate remain explicit integration blockers. No additional source improvement is required before focused verification.

## Verified checkpoint

Verification passed by exact source review and git diff --check for a1120a64b19564b6b57e47634f7d6783b54355c5. This leaf changes only complete diagnostic YAML steps (plus pdf2html's explicit Docker build-record opt-out) and this gate record. No matching existing focused source contract was found, so no application build, browser suite, or new mirror test was run for this reversible change. This is static verification, not a claim of K3s runtime acceptance. The unchanged project landing checks remain required.

Publication: the supported publish-pr-source helper pushed and verified this exact implementation SHA on the feature branch. Main, releases, package publication and account settings were untouched. Source audit and verification-summary.json are retained in the ignored task directory. Scope-limited gate closure does not authorize or claim merge/deploy.
